    <font size="+2">Holiday season! All those pretty snowscapes, all those heavenly tropical white-sand beaches - how fortuitous that Christmas comes when some of the world's best winter-sun destinations are at their peak. Where are the best places to spend New Year's Eve? What to do at Christmas and New Year? Where can you escape the holiday crowds? One thing's for sure: don't even think of returning to the office in boring old January without a tan and the look of someone who just had the most fun Christmas holidays ever.</font>
