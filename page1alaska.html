Alaska is the land of superlatives: largest national park, highest peak, longest coastline, biggest state, longest day and night. The list goes on, and with all of these unparalleled characteristics, you'd be hard pressed to cover even a fraction of this place in a typical one- or two-week vacation period. The 49th state offers so many things to do and see, you could vacation here for the rest of your life and never have the same experience twice.
