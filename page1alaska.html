Alaska is the land of superlatives: largest national park, highest peak, longest coastline, biggest state, longest day and night. The list goes on, and with all of these unparalleled characteristics, you'd be hard pressed to cover even a fraction of this place in a typical one- or two-week vacation period. The 49th state offers so many things to do and see, I could vacation here for the rest of my life and never have the same experience twice. I would go, at list, to see two cities Anchorage and Fairbanks.
