	<p> Miami is one of the most trendy cities in the US. Not only does the city habe a vibrant nightlife with many cool nightclubs, it also has beaches such as Miami Beach which are some of Miami’s best attractions. The tropical beaches alone make Miami a perfect mix between American culture and the Caribbean. The reason for Miami having so much Caribbean influences is because of its population. The Cuban district ‘Little Havana’ is a perfect example of this and definitely one of Miami’s top things to see. A culinary tour ($60) in this neighborhood is one of the most popular tours in Miami</p>
