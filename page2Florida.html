Florida, the southeastern most state in the US, is certainly not a dull place. It is one of the largest states in the US and is home to a wide variety of ethnicities and cultures. Situated between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida is famed for its amusement parks and offers the largest selection of zoos, aquariums, theme parks and other family attractions found in any of the US states. </font>
