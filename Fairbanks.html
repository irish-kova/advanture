	<p> If i go to Alaska, i will take a  <a href="AlaskaRailroad.html">Railroad</a> or fly to Fairbanks to look at <a href="TheNorthernLights.html">The Northern Lights</a>. At 65 degrees north latitude, the sky takes on a capricious life of its ownâ€”a canvas for the aurora borealis, the midnight sun and sunsets and sunrises that last forever. Here there are serious mountain ranges, pristine rivers and lakes, abundant wildlife and a certain poignant solitude that is found nowhere else on earth. Locals embrace the natural world and have created a vibrant river city in the far north. Where else can you travel to such a remote locale and still enjoy all the amenities of a charming downtown, a thriving arts community, rich Alaska Native culture, authentic Alaskan activities and attractions and endless opportunities for exploration? </p>
